Description: 
1. This is a personal project

2. The purpose for this project is to assit myself design and build a shelf that can be placed between the wall and the other side of 
   my desk

3. The reason of building this shelf is because 

            a. my current desk is not deep enough after having a monitor sitting on top of it
            b. the gap space only can hold objects that have 9 inch or less in depth, and most shelves sold on the market are too deep

4. Procedure

            a. create a 3D environment and furnitures that goes inside of it
            b. design a shelf, and try to place it at the spot that I would put it in the real senario
            c. if everything worked fine, then I will generate an engineering drawing based on the model, and start to purchase building 
               materials
            d. build it!
