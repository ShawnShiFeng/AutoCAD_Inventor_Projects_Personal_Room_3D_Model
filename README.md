Description: This is a personal project. I need to build a shelf that can be sliced through the gap between the desk and the wall, because
the desk I have right now is not deep enough, and I don't have room to study after I put a monitor on the desk. 
In order to do so, I learned to use AutoCAD by myself, and I used that knowledge to create a 3D model for my current rental room, and
based on the model, I can create a drawing for the shelf, and make sure that everything is perfect and fit before I started to buy any 
materials.
